## Soft Bans (max 1-2 per paper)
- significant/significantly (prefer "substantial", "material", "economically meaningful", or give the number)
- novel (prefer "new" or describe what's new)
- robust (fine in "robustness checks" but don't overuse)
- key (often filler)
- critical/critically (prefer "important" or be specific)
- highlights (prefer "shows", "reveals"; max 2 per paper)
- insights (prefer stating what was learned directly; max 1 per paper)
- compelling (prefer "strong" or just present the evidence)
- ultimately (often filler; delete or restructure)
- somewhat (delete or give the magnitude: "somewhat larger" → "12bp larger") (Nikolov/Sword)
- quite (delete or quantify) (Nikolov)
- very (as intensifier; delete: "very few" → "few") (Nikolov: "very often very unnecessary")
- rather (as hedge, not in "rather than") (Nikolov)
- arguably (delete; present evidence instead) (Nikolov)
- perhaps (delete or present evidence) (Nikolov)
- especially (replace with number: "especially large" → "140 basis points") (Nikolov)
- particularly (same as above; replace with number)
- a variety of (name the types)
- the extent to which (restructure to state the result)
- in general (delete or quantify the exception)
- Indeed, (as sentence opener; AI amplifier; delete)
- as noted above (restructure; variant of "Recall from")

## Structural AI Tells to Avoid
- "Together, these results..." as a paragraph opener (max 1 per paper; vary with "Collectively," or restructure)
- "This finding" as sentence opener (max 1 per paper; vary: "The result", "The evidence", name the specific finding)
- "In this section, we..." throat-clearing (just start with the content)
- Naked "this" without a noun ("This implies..." → "This result implies...")
- "Importantly," / "Notably," / "Specifically," as sentence-opening adverbs (delete or fold into the sentence)
- "Overall," as a paragraph opener (restructure)
- Uniform paragraph length (vary: some 2-sentence, some 6-sentence)
- Consecutive same-structure paragraph openers: No two consecutive paragraphs begin with the same grammatical construction (e.g., two adverb-comma openers, two "The..." openers). Vary: subject-verb, prepositional phrase, dependent clause. (GPTZero burstiness metric)
- Content-free meta-announcements: Delete any sentence that announces the next topic without providing content. "We now turn to X" → just start with the finding. Exception: one orienting sentence at section start if it names the specific question. (Sage peer-review guide 2025; Cochrane)
- "First...Second" enumeration overuse: Limit parallel enumeration to genuinely parallel, discrete items. For causal chains, use prose. Max one "First...Second" structure per subsection.
- Closing-summary paragraphs within sections: Do not end a section with a paragraph that merely restates. Each paragraph must advance the argument. Summary belongs in Conclusion only. (Detection research: "over-explanation without deepening")
- Symmetric hedges when data exist: Replace "can be positive or negative, depending on..." with the empirical answer when you have data.
- Gerund-phrase opener density: Max one gerund-phrase opener ("Using a large dataset, we...") per paragraph. High density is a syntactic AI tell. (Burstiness research)
- Padding appositives: Define a concept once. After definition, use the name without appositives restating the definition.
- Sentence length variation: Mix short declarative sentences (8-12 words) with longer compounds (25-40 words). Five consecutive sentences of similar length is an AI tell. (GPTZero/Turnitin burstiness; Kobak 2025)
- Intensive reflexive pronouns as emphasis ("itself", "themselves"): When the pronoun adds emphasis but no semantic distinction, delete it. "rivals sampling uncertainty itself" → "rivals sampling uncertainty." When it distinguishes X from Y, make the contrast explicit instead: "the signal itself" → "the signal, not the mapping" or restructure. Max 2 uses of "itself/themselves" per paper, each earning its place.

## Never Stack Superlatives
Bad: "These results provide crucial new insights into this important phenomenon."
Good: "These results show that X."
